# Covid-19 Global Statistic Tableau Dashboard
![](https://i.imgur.com/ErYFH9U.png)

Welcome to my first Tableau dashboard! The viral pandemic is a hot topic all over the world. Every country has implemented their own form of public health measures, ranging from Denmark's herd immunity policies to China's Zero Covid policies. Are some countries better than others at curbing the spread of the virus? Which country has the highest pandemic death toll?

This dashboard summarises the global statistics from the start of the outbreak in Jan 2020 up till 6 Dec 2022. 

Questions to be answered:
* What is the death toll of Covid-19 so far?
* What is the global death rate of Covid-19?
* Which are the countries with the highest death counts?
* Which country has the highest proportion of the infected population?
